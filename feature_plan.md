# Shopping Assistant - Target Automation Integration

As you complete tasks and reference relevant files update this file as our memory to help with future tasks.

## Goal
Connect the Slack Shopping Assistant with Target Automation using a semi-automated approach that maintains human oversight while streamlining the shopping process.

## Overall Approach
- Maintain the current Slack shopping list functionality
- When `/order-placed` is executed, generate an export file for the automation
- Notify admins when the list is ready for automation
- Provide a bridge script to connect the systems
- Maintain human oversight before actual purchases

## Tasks

### 1. Modify `/order-placed` Command for Export ✅
- [x] Identify where to modify the command handler in `slack_handler.py`
- [x] Create a function to export active shopping items to JSON
- [x] Save the export file to a configurable location
- [x] Add notification for admin when export is ready
- [x] Update logging to track export process

### 2. Create a Bridge Script ✅
- [x] Create a new Python script `target_bridge.py`
- [x] Implement function to read the exported shopping list
- [x] Add placeholder for launching Target automation
- [x] Implement result logging back to Slack
- [x] Add error handling and configuration options

### 3. Environment Configuration ✅
- [x] Add new environment variables for file paths and automation settings
- [x] Update `.env` file with required variables
- [x] Document the new environment variables
- [x] Create a sample configuration

### 4. Documentation & Testing ✅
- [x] Create documentation for the integration process
- [x] Add usage instructions for administrators
- [x] Create test cases to validate the export functionality
- [x] Test the bridge script with sample data

### 5. Enhance Product Search with GPT-4o-mini Search Preview ✅
- [x] Update `product_service.py` to implement GPT-4o-mini search preview
- [x] Configure web search capabilities for accurate Target product data
- [x] Add validation for returned URLs to ensure they are valid
- [x] Update error handling for the new search implementation
- [x] Test the enhanced search functionality

## Implementation Summary

### Task 1: Modify `/order-placed` Command (Complete)
- Added a function called `export_shopping_list` to `utils.py` that exports active shopping items to JSON or TXT files
- Implemented the export directory creation if it doesn't exist
- Added timestamp-based filenames for export files
- Modified the `/order-placed` command to export items before marking them as ordered
- Added private admin notifications about the export with instructions

### Task 2: Create Bridge Script (Complete)
- Created `target_bridge.py` script that serves as a bridge between Slack and Target automation
- Implemented functionality to find and load the latest export
- Added placeholder for Target automation launch functionality
- Implemented Slack notification for automation results
- Added command-line interface with options for configuration and file paths

### Task 3: Environment Configuration (Complete)
- Added the following environment variables to `.env`:
  - `EXPORT_DIR`: Directory where export files will be saved
  - `EXPORT_FORMAT`: Format for export files ("json" or "txt")
  - `TARGET_AUTOMATION_PATH`: Path to the Target automation script/executable
- Created a sample configuration in `target_bridge.py`
- Added requests module to requirements.txt

### Task 4: Documentation & Testing (Complete)
- Added detailed documentation to README.md explaining the integration
- Created usage instructions for administrators
- Added examples of how to run the bridge script
- Created a test script (`test_bridge.py`) that validates the functionality
- Generated sample data for testing
- Successfully tested the bridge script

### Task 5: Enhance Product Search (Complete)
- Updated the product search functionality to use OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini Search Preview
- Successfully replaced the previous approach which generated plausible but potentially invalid Target URLs
- Implemented web search capabilities to provide real-time, accurate product information
- Added robust validation and error handling for JSON extraction from responses
- Added URL validation and normalization to ensure all returned URLs are valid
- Improved format handling to process various response structures
- Created and tested a test script (`test_search.py`) to verify the new search functionality
- Tests confirmed valid Target product URLs are consistently returned

## Next Steps for Future Implementation

1. **Integration with actual Target Automation**: Update the `launch_automation` method in the bridge script to work with the specific Target automation system.

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Add more robust error handling, perhaps retry logic for failed automation attempts.

3. **Scheduled Processing**: Consider adding an option to automatically process the latest export file at scheduled intervals.

4. **UI Improvements**: Consider adding interactive elements in Slack to approve or reject automation runs.

5. **Analytics**: Track success rates and statistics for automated orders.
