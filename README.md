# Slack Shopping Agent (LangChain Version)

This project implements a Slack agent that acts as a conversational agent to manage a shared weekly shopping list, primarily focusing on products from Target.com. It uses LangChain with an OpenAI model (GPT-4 Turbo recommended) to understand natural language requests and interact with various tools for scraping, searching, and database management.

## Features

* **Conversational Interaction:** Add, search, view, and delete items using natural language by mentioning the agent in Slack (e.g., `@ShopAgent add https://...`, `@ShopAgent find milk`).
* **Add Item via URL:** Provide a Target.com product URL, and the agent will scrape details (title, price) and ask for quantity before adding.
* **Search Items:** Ask the agent to find items on Target (e.g., "find cheap snacks"). It will present options, and you can choose one to add after specifying quantity.
* **View List:** Ask the agent "what's on the list?" to see all currently active items.
* **Delete Item:** Ask the agent to remove an item you added using its description or ID (e.g., "delete the cookies", "remove item id 5").
* **Weekly Reminder:** Automatically posts a reminder message to a designated channel every Friday at 5 PM (configurable timezone).
* **Order Placement:** An admin can use the `/order-placed` slash command to notify the channel that the order has been made and clear the active list.
* **Context-Aware:** Uses conversation memory to handle multi-step interactions like asking for quantity after finding/scraping an item.

## Technology Stack

* **Python:** Core programming language (3.10+).
* **LangChain:** Framework for building language model applications, handling the agent logic, tool usage, and memory.
* **OpenAI API:** Powers the language model (GPT-4 Turbo recommended) for understanding and responding.
* **FastAPI:** Asynchronous web framework for handling incoming Slack requests.
* **Slack Bolt for Python:** SDK for simplifying Slack API interactions and event handling.
* **Playwright:** For robust browser automation to scrape JavaScript-heavy Target product pages.
* **BeautifulSoup4:** For parsing HTML content obtained via Playwright.
* **APScheduler:** For scheduling the weekly reminder message.
* **SQLite:** Simple file-based database for storing the shopping list.
* **Docker:** For containerizing the application, ensuring consistent deployment and managing dependencies like Playwright.
* **Uvicorn:** ASGI server to run the FastAPI application.

## Setup & Installation

**Prerequisites:**

* Git installed.
* Python 3.10 or higher installed.
* Docker installed and running.
* A GitHub account (or GitLab/Bitbucket).
* A Slack workspace where you can install apps.
* An OpenAI API key ([platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/)).
* A Render account ([render.com](https://render.com/)).

**Steps:**

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/slack-shopping-agent-langchain.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/slack-shopping-agent-langchain.git) # Replace with your repo URL
    cd slack-shopping-agent-langchain
    ```

2.  **Environment Variables (Local Development):**
    * Create a file named `.env` in the project root.
    * **IMPORTANT:** Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file. **Do NOT commit your `.env` file.**
    * Add the following keys, replacing the placeholder values:
        ```dotenv
        # .env - For local development ONLY
        SLACK_AGENT_TOKEN=xoxb-your-slack-agent-token
        SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=your-slack-signing-secret
        OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key
        TARGET_CHANNEL_ID=C123ABC456 # ID of the Slack channel for reminders/notifications
        DATABASE_PATH=./shopping_list.db # Path for local SQLite file
        TZ=Asia/Jerusalem # Or your local timezone e.g., America/New_York, Europe/London
        ```

3.  **Install Python Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Install Playwright Browsers:**
    * This downloads the necessary browser binaries for Playwright.
    ```bash
    playwright install --with-deps chromium
    # Or: playwright install --with-deps # Installs browsers listed in playwright config (if any)
    ```

5.  **Initialize Database (Local):**
    * The application will automatically create the `shopping_list.db` file (using the `DATABASE_PATH` from `.env`) and run the schema setup (`db_schema.sql`) the first time it starts if the file doesn't exist.

## Running Locally (Optional)

Running locally is useful for testing and debugging but requires exposing your local server to the internet for Slack API calls.

1.  **Ensure `.env` file is configured** with your test tokens/keys.
2.  **Use `ngrok` or a similar tool:**
    * Download and install ngrok ([ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com/)).
    * Expose your local port (default is 8000):
        ```bash
        ngrok http 8000
        ```
    * ngrok will provide a public HTTPS URL (e.g., `https://randomstring.ngrok.io`).
3.  **Update Slack App URLs:** Go to your Slack app settings and temporarily update the Request URLs for Event Subscriptions, Interactivity, and Slash Commands to use your `ngrok` HTTPS URL (e.g., `https://randomstring.ngrok.io/slack/events`).
4.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:api --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
    ```
5.  Test interactions by mentioning the agent in your test Slack channel. Remember to revert Slack URLs when deploying.

## Deployment (Render)

This application is designed to be deployed easily on Render using Docker.

        * `PORT`: `8000` (Render sets this, but good to include).
5.  **Deploy:** Click "Create Web Service". Wait for the build and deployment process to complete. Monitor the logs for errors.
6.  **Update Slack App Request URLs:**
    * Copy your service's URL from Render (e.g., `https://your-app-name.onrender.com`).
    * Go back to your Slack App configuration page ([api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps)).
    * Update the Request URLs for:
        * **Event Subscriptions:** `https://your-app-name.onrender.com/slack/events`
        * **Interactivity & Shortcuts:** `https://your-app-name.onrender.com/slack/interactive`
        * **Slash Commands (`/order-placed`):** `https://your-app-name.onrender.com/slack/commands`
    * Save changes in Slack. You might need to reinstall the app to your workspace.

## Slack App Configuration Summary

Ensure your Slack App is configured with:

* **Agent User:** Added.
* **Scopes (Agent Token):** `app_mentions:read`, `chat:write`, `commands`, `users:read`, `channels:history`.
* **Event Subscriptions:** Enabled, Request URL set, Subscribed to `app_mention` agent event.
* **Interactivity & Shortcuts:** Enabled, Request URL set (even if no interactive components are currently used).

## Usage

* **Primary Interaction:** Mention the agent in the designated Slack channel: `@YourAgentName <your request>`.
* **Examples:**
    * `@YourAgentName add https://www.target.com/p/tide-pods...` (Follow prompts for quantity)
    * `@YourAgentName can you find laundry detergent?` (Review options, confirm selection, provide quantity)
    * `@YourAgentName what is on the shopping list?`
    * `@YourAgentName please delete the Tide Pods`
    * `@YourAgentName remove item 3` (If you know the Item ID from viewing the list)
    * `@YourAgentName hello` (Test basic interaction)
* **Admin Command:** Use `/order-placed` to mark the list as complete and notify the channel.

## Important Notes & Caveats

* ðŸš¨ **Target Scraping:** The CSS selectors used in `product_service.py` to scrape Target.com are **highly likely to break** when Target updates their website. This is the most fragile part of the agent and will require manual updates to the selectors periodically. Consider using professional scraping APIs for more robustness if needed.
* **LLM Reliability:** The agent's understanding of natural language depends on the OpenAI model and the quality of the system prompt (`agent_executor.py`). Complex or ambiguous requests might be misunderstood. The prompt may need tuning based on observed behavior.
* **API Costs:** Using the OpenAI API (especially GPT-4) for processing messages incurs costs. Monitor your OpenAI usage. Consider using GPT-3.5 Turbo for lower costs if acceptable.
* **Security:** Keep your Slack tokens, signing secret, and OpenAI API key secure. Do not commit them directly into your code or `.env`

## Local Testing

To test the agent functionality locally without deploying to Slack:

1. Make sure your environment is set up with all dependencies installed:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Ensure your `.env` file contains the necessary API keys:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key
   DATABASE_PATH=./shopping_list.db
   ```

3. Run the test script:
   ```bash
   python test_agent.py
   ```

4. Interact with the agent directly in your console by typing queries like:
   - "find milk"
   - "what's on the shopping list?"
   - "add https://www.target.com/p/some-product-url"
   - "delete item 1"

The test script creates an interactive session where you can test the agent's capabilities without needing to deploy to Slack.
